# Parallel killer-feature implementations

Use these as three parallel tracks (for three environments/branches):

- **Environment #1 → Killer Feature #1 (Behavioral CI Gate):** `examples/killer_feature_1_ci_gate.py`
- **Environment #2 → Killer Feature #2 (Trace-aware Guardrails):** `examples/killer_feature_2_trace_guard.py`
- **Environment #3 → Killer Feature #3 (Model-selection Workflow):** `examples/killer_feature_3_model_selection.py`

Each script is self-contained and runnable from the repo root.
