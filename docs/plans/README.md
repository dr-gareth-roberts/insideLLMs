# Planning Documents (Archival)

Documents in this directory are **archival** — they describe past design decisions, migration plans, or implementation notes that may reference removed or deprecated modules. They are kept for historical context and migration reference.

**Do not treat these as current API guidance.** For up-to-date documentation, see:

- `docs/STABILITY_MATRIX.md` — API stability contract
- `docs/IMPORT_PATHS.md` — Canonical import paths
- `DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md` — Documentation index
